# dfu-character-background-swapper

Adds support for paperdoll background swapping depending on variables

### Night
If it is night, a "_NIGHT" texture will be used, if it exists.

Example: ``SCBG00I0_NIGHT.IMG``

### Weather
The weather tags are as follows: "_RAIN", "_SNOW", "_STORM", "_FOG", "_OVERCAST".

Example: ``SCBG00I0_RAIN.IMG``

### Combinations
Weather and Time can be combo'd however you'd like!

Example: ``SCBG00I0_NIGHT_SNOW.IMG``
Example: ``SCBG00I0_SNOW_NIGHT.IMG``

I'm guessing you don't want to make rain+storm variants, so you can just have a copied image for both storm and rain. Same for overcast, totally up to you!
